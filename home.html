Great location for getting anywhere around the central city. The beds were fantastic. Just bliss when you put your head on the pillow and snuggled in those luxurious linens. I have to say this because so often in NZ those that rent private accommodation do not make this a priority.

Great house in a perfect location close to all the main areas in Auckland. Brendan and Natalie were great hosts. Very communicative and helpful from minute one and took care of anything I needed. Would totally recommend this place if you want to spend some quality time in Auckland.

Brendan was a fantastic host. I stayed the weekend with my partner and then worked the week with my business partner, and the apartment proved perfect for both purposes. It's about 15 min walk to Ponsonby for breakfasts and eating out, and the same to the CBD for work. The apartment comfortably slept two travelling co-workers and the view over the Auckland skyline is lovely. Thanks again.

Beautiful, ideally situated modern apartment. Brendan and Natalie were fantastic and really helpful. I would definitely recommend this place and if the chances arrive, will stay there again for sure.

My friend and I stayed at this apartment for 10 nights. It was AMAZING. Close to a supermarket, sky tower, city and the wharf. Super clean and comfy, beds were fantastic and comfy. Nice quiet area and would stay here again in a heart beat. Just perfect. Also amazing view of the skytower during the day and night!

Staying at Brendan and Natalie's place was everything my group could have wished for and more. The apartment was spotless, safe, and a prime location with parking. Better yet, Brendan made it easy for us to have an early check-in and late check-out based on our travel needs. I could not say enough good things about our experience here!

Awesome location in a really well appointed modern apartment. You are central but still feel secluded from the hustle and noise of the city. Brendan and Natalie were great hosts and made us feel very welcome on our arrival. We look forward to staying here again in the future.

Brendan, very quick and easy to deal with. The perfect city apartment with amazing views, very clean, close to supermarket, and brilliant parking facilities for 2 cars. And also free parking for guests up to 3 hrs which is amazing in a city location. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a place in Auckland stay here.

Everything was perfect. A great modern apartment. Spotless clean. Great for young and old travellers and even young families. One block away from a large supermarket that is open till midnight 7 days a week. Opposite Victoria park and down the road from Ponsonby which has everything anyone needs from trendy shops to great restaurants and bars. But it's the little things that made our stay so great. Hosts were in contact to check if they could help. There was a Nesspresso machine with Pods ready to go. Brendan and Natalie knew we had young children and offered to help whenever they could. Thanks Brendan and Natalie and see you next time we come to stay.

Brendan and Natalie were very helpful and lovely hosts. Very accomodating when our flight was delayed and we arrived late. The apartment is freshly renovated and looks just like the photos- very clean & great view! Close to buses, parks/playgrounds and supermarket. Great to have access to the pool downstairs too- the kids loved it (2 & 5) Thank you for having us.

The property is in a fantastic location, which is literally a 10 - 15 minute walk into the city. Everything has been thought of including the little things like tea / coffee, milk, washing powder etc. The place was immaculately clean with the comfiest beds you could wish for. We spent 3 nights here and wished we could stay longer.
